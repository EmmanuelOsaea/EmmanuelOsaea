# Title: Trends in Cannabis Use: A Comprehensive Analysis of Canadian Data Post-Legalization.  


Introduction: This report examines the prevalence of cannabis usage in Canada following its legalization for recreational purposes in 2018. 
By analyzing recent data, this report aims to provide insights into the extent of cannabis use across different demographics and regions in Canada.

Data Collection: A study conducted by Statistics Canada in 2023 surveyed 10,000 Canadians aged 15 and older to gather data on cannabis use. 
The study found that 28% of Canadians reported using cannabis in the past year, up from 25% in 2022. 
Among those who reported using cannabis, 65% reported using it for non-medical purposes, while 35% reported using it for medical purposes. 
The study also found that cannabis use was more prevalent among younger age groups, with 45% of those aged 15 to 24 reporting cannabis use in the past year compared to 10% of those aged 65 and older.

Key Findings:
There was no clear trend for past 12-month cannabis use among youth age 16-19. In 2023, 43% of youth reported using cannabis at least once in the past 12 months, an increase compared to 2022 and 2018 (which had rates of 37% and 36% respectively). 
However, this rate was similar to that in 2019 and 2020 (44% each year).

Overall, the proportion of respondents who use cannabis and reported daily or almost daily use has been stable since 2018 (approximately 25%), including among youth (approximately 20%).

The percentage of Canadians who use cannabis classified as 'at high risk' of developing problems from cannabis use has remained stable since 2018 (approximately 3%).

The proportion of Canadians smoking cannabis continued to decline. However, in 2023, smoking remains the most common method of consuming cannabis (63%), followed by eating (52%) and vapourizing with a vape pen or e-cigarette (33%).

The number of respondents reporting a legal source as their usual source of cannabis has increased to 73 % in 2023 from 37% in 2019 with legal storefronts being the most common source since 2019. 
A smaller proportion reporting accessing cannabis through illegal sources compared to 2019.

Among those who used cannabis, driving after recent use decreased between 2018 (27%) and 2021 (16%), and has remained unchanged since then.

Conclusion: The results from the Canadian Cannabis Survey will help Health Canada better understand habits and behaviours relative to cannabis use over time and will support the development of policy and program initiatives, including public education and awareness activities. 
The data from the survey will also help to inform theÂ legislative reviewÂ of theÂ Cannabis Act,which is being led by an independentÂ expert panel.
